# UFOAnalysis
An in depth analysis of UFO sightings. We used logistic regression, support vector machine, linear regression, K-Means clustering to analyze our data. We used these analysis techniques to answer the questions/tasks: 

Our three Data Analysis Tasks are: 
Based on the comments about the UFO sighting, what are the different UFO colors seen?
Can we predict the city of the UFO sighting based on the latitude and longitude?
Can we predict the length of the UFO encounter in seconds, and how accurate would this model be?

The three EDA our team wants to discover are:
What are the top ten cities most ufos were seen in
What country had the longest sighting of a ufo?
Have sightings increased as the years go by?
Which month had the longest UFO sighting?
